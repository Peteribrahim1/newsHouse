# NEWS HOUSE

## DESCRIPTION OF THE APP
NEWSHOUSE is an amazing news mobile app that provides interesting and updated news to its users. The news is coming from a reliable API that keeps updating the app with latest news automaticaaly. The app also contains google ads, and no user information is collected; so users dont have to worry about data and privacy misuse. The app has a very nice and seamless user interface with great functionality.

## DESCRIPTION OF CODE BASE
The code base is structured with a total number of 4 folders which I used to structure my app in a very clean and orderlly manner. The first folder is named "model" and it contains the model structure file of the news responses. The next folder is called "providers"and it houses the provider file which contains the api call and some state management code. The next folder is called "screens" which contains all the screen files in the app. The last folder is named widgets and it contains all the extracted widgets in the app.

## HOW TO USE THE APP
After launching the app the first screen that comes up is the splash screen and it displays the logo of the app for 3 seconds. Then it moves to the news screen that displays a list of news in a listview builder. On tapping any of the news the app takes the user to the details screen of that news and displays a more detailed information on that particular news. The user is presented with buttons to take them back the the main news list.

## DESCRIPTION OF LIBRARIES USED
1. ### Provider
   I made use of the provider state management tool in the implementation of my API call and sharing of data within the app.

2. ### shared_preferences
   Shared_preferences was part of what i needed for the implentation of the light/dark mode.
   
3. ### http
   I made use of the http package to enable me make network calls to the API.

4. ### google_mobile_ads
   I made use of google_mobile_ads to integrate google advertisement inorder to monetize my app.
   
5. ### flutter_native_splash
   I made use of flutter native splash to implement a splash screen and also to remove the white screen that comes up at the start of flutter apps.

## CHALLENGES FACED AND HOW I OVERCAME
   I had challenge with sorting data from the API but i used stackoverflow and google to get solutions that helped me solve the problem.
   
## FEATURES I WOULD LOVE TO ADD IF I HAD MORE TIME
   Automatic language detector.
